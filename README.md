# DeepTrajectory

DeepTrajectory is a deep recurrent neural network based on gated recurrent units to identify improved conformational states from refinement trajectory data in order to assist accurate protein structure prediction.

This repository contains the source code of the model together with helper functions to measure the performance during training and validation.


## Usage

Dependencies: tensorflow (version 1.0.0), scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
